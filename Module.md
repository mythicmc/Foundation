# Module Foundation

Foundation is a collection of useful tools and utilities for Paper and Velocity plugins.

# Package org.mythicmc.foundation

Contains metadata about the currently loaded version of Foundation.

# Package org.mythicmc.foundation.platform.v0

`platform-v0` (unstable) provides a uniform API for plugins, with functionality that works across server software like Paper and Velocity.

Currently, Foundation is the only intended consumer of this package. If other plugins would like to make use of this package, we could pursue stabilising the API in the future. 

Note: v0 packages are experimental and unstable. APIs are subject to breakage, and no stability is guaranteed!

# Package org.mythicmc.foundation.rosetta.v1

`rosetta-v1` provides APIs for lang file handling and enabling uniformity across system messages generated by plugins.

It includes APIs for lang file handling and retrieving prefixes and color schemes for system messages. These prefixes and color schemes are consistent server-wide and can be modified by server administrators.
